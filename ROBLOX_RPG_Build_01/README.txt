This is an incomplete prototype. The game functions, however numerous core features are missing. Following, there is not yet any story in this game. A general synopsis will be posted below. All visuals and audio is subject to change.

Story (taken from a couple discord messages):
"so like the concept started with me wanting to make an rpg on roblox but i actually kinda didn't wanna do that so i decided to just base the story and world off of that. i think a short summary would be that you play as a builder and architect on the outskirts of a town in robloxia, who values creativity a lot. thus you spend a lot of your time designing and building structures. the inciting incident comes when you notice roblox starting to stifle that creativity and make things more cookie-cutter, so you decide to go personally protest to builderman. on the course of your journey you encounter several characters who join your party, notably a pumpkin head cough cough dusekkar cough cough and a twink who really like gardening. notably because those are the only other 2 i've designed so far. you also encounter several notable villains (1x and john doe haha i'm gonna steal designs), who you at first believe are a third party entirely against robloxia but you soon discover are a part of it. you also encounter a variety of locations that existed long before robloxia existed, a source of magic and fantastical areas that stand in contrast to the towns and cities you started in, with robloxia slowly wiping out the people living there and placing suburbs and cities on top. that's right it's also about colonialism. after witnessing everything on your journey and some stern beating from your party members for your belief in robloxia as a state, your objective changes: kill CEOs. once you reach builderman, however, he wipes out all your party members but you and has a 1 on 1 chat with you, talking about how killing him would be pointless as he is simply a leader who could easily be replaced, and shows you a large machine being built under robloxia, meant to connect to other branches of the same machine. He talks about how robloxia has always existed in this way, that it was always meant to grow, build this machine, how the creativity was always going to be stifled in the name of that growth. there you have a final battle, where you kill him and then destroy said part of the machine. perhaps the victory is hollow, and perhaps robloxia crumbles, but it still has the opportunity to build something new, built on its community rather than a need for growth like a cancer.

i'm also hoping it's not too nihilistic i wanna demonstrate the creative power of community outside of the efforts of corporations through party members, how you affect the areas you visit, and what those areas are like themselves

oh also i need to remember that a main theme of this is an examination of my own relationship to roblox, with a core theme being the idea that even though roblox is getting worse, more corporate and predatory, the seeds were always there and this was always the end goal of roblox being a for-profit corporation and a part of capitalism. it will always have destroyed any semblance of orignality and personality, committed more outwardly evil and predatory acts in the name of profit, as that was always the end goal. the desire for growth would have it eat and destroy its own innards to grow further into a grotesque beast, or more aptly, wear all that it is thin to make its machine bigger, and destroy everything around it in the process. In other words, roblox originally was a platform that allowed creativity both in the company and community, and allowed for a social community to grow through this, but for the sake of profit it gutted this in favor of marketability, exploiting and extracting its devs for more and more profit and growth"
